# graphdeclarative function composition inspired by prismatics [graph](https://github.com/Prismatic/plumbing) library## Getting Started_With component_  	$ component install jkroso/graph_With npm_  	$ npm install jkroso/graph --save```javascriptvar graph = require('graph')```## API  - [graph()](#graphobject)### graph(graph:Object)  compile a graph to a function. The input graph must be acyclic (no circular dependencies).## Running the testsRunning the test in node is just a matter of executing `make test`Running in the browser though requires a build. To do that execute `make test/built.js`. You should then be able to open your browser to the test directory and watch the suite run._Note: before you can run any tests you will need to execute `npm install` and nothing works on a windows pc_## License[MIT](License)
